## I. Overview

ABC Company values its relationships with our health care customers, service providers, and regulators.  Managing compliance requirements helps us maximize our opportunities in the market, enhances our competitive position, and helps build trust.

## II. Purpose

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and Canadian Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) specify security standards, privacy requirements, and security breach notification procedures.  A strong health care compliance program provides our organization with a competitive advantage, helps protect our image and reputation, and reduces our costs.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all ABC Company Staff who have access to or manage Information Resources that collect, transmit, process, or store health care related data.

## IV. Policy

HIPAA is designed to protect sensitive health care information through improved security standards and privacy legislation.  It defines requirements for collecting, storing, and transmitting patient information.  It also identifies compliance guidelines for critical business tasks such as risk analysis, awareness training, audit trail, disaster recovery plans, information access, and encryption.
HITECH requires entities, business associates, vendors of personal health records and related entities to notify individuals when their personal health information is subject to a breach of security.  To limit exposure, limited data sets with de-identified data shall be used to disclose only the minimum necessary protected health information.
To meet compliance requirements, ABC Company shall implement the required information security standards as outlined in the HIPAA Security Rule.  The security standards are organized into three major safeguard areas:
Administrative Safeguards - policies and procedures for day-to-day operations, managing the conduct of employees with access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) as well as managing the selection, development, and use of security controls.
Physical Safeguards - security measures that protect an organization's electronic information systems, buildings, and equipment from natural hazards, environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.
Technical Safeguards - security measures that specify how to use technology to protect electronically protected health information and access to such information.
The table below identifies ABC Company policies and plans that implement and maintain specific Safeguards to meet HIPAA, HITECH, and PHIPA compliance requirements.  While larger firms generally have a designated Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), smaller organizations may have a Chief Security Official (CSO) fulfill these duties.  For more information on Business Associates, refer to the Third Party Service Providers Policy.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff member found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all ABC Company Staff who have access to or manage Information Resources that collect, transmit, process, or store health care related data.
