## IV. Policy

HITRUST’s Common Security Framework (CSF) helps organizations create, access, store, and exchange Protected Health Information (PHI) in a safe and secure manner.  The CSF is based on health care security regulations, standards, and frameworks such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and International Standards Organization (ISO) 27799:2008 Health informatics, information security management in health using ISO/IEC 27002.
CSF consolidates relevant globally recognized standards, regulations, and business requirements into a risk-based approach to security, privacy, and regulatory challenges.  CSF includes Control Categories which contain Control Objectives and Control Specifications.
The table below summarizes {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} policies and plans that implement and maintain specific Safeguards to help meet HITRUST compliance requirements.
Note: Policy/Plan names listed above may provide guidance and direction over more than one control category.
