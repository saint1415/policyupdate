Approval Process
The IT Department is the sole authority for submitting requisitions for IT equipment on behalf of any department that has approval to obtain such equipment.
All IT related hardware and software will be specified by the IT Director. Hardware and software cannot be purchased without a completed IT procurement authorization form.  This form needs to be completed and signed by the user's line manager.  Upon receipt of the completed form, IT will record the request and the IT Director will make a decision whether to approve, decline or amend the requirements for the purchase of the IT related products and/or services.
If the request is approved, IT will forward the request to the Purchasing Department for fulfillment.
If declined or changed, the IT Director will provide a brief explanation to the requesting manager.
Equipment suppliers may be recommended by the IT Department but may be changed on a periodic basis.
Product Delivery
The IT Department will request that equipment be delivered to the IT Department where it can be checked for damage and compliance with the ordered specification prior to being set up and transported to its final destination.
The IT Department will inform the original requestor of the equipment when the equipment is delivered to the IT Department, and will make arrangements for installation.
The IT Department has a standard set-up procedure for new hardware, software and systems. This procedure ensures the equipment is configured correctly and that all IT security measures are addressed. This includes the setup of passwords, anti-virus software, and security.
Installation of replacement equipment will be given priority over new equipment in order to maintain continuity in the existing service.
A program for the systematic monitoring and evaluation to ensure that standards of quality are being met shall be established for all software developed or acquired by {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.  Quality evaluation and acceptance criteria for information systems, upgrades, and new versions shall be established, documented and tests of the system(s) shall be carried out both during development and prior to acceptance to maintain security.
Management shall have a clear oversight capacity in the quality testing process with the final product being certified as:
Fit for purpose - the product should be suitable for the intended purpose, and
Right first time - mistakes should be eliminated prior to release.
Commercially procured software shall be tested to ensure that the software contains no obvious features that might be detrimental to the security of the information system.
