## I. Overview

{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} uses outsourcing as a means of reducing costs, accessing specialist expertise, and providing greater focus on non-core functions.  This process must be managed to ensure the proper benefits are received and risks remain within acceptable levels.

## II. Purpose

Outsourcing involves the use of third party service providers to perform activities on a continuing basis (including agreements for a limited period), that would normally be undertaken by {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.  This policy manages the risks related to outsourcing.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all Staff responsible for outsourcing {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} functions and activities.

## IV. Policy

Department Heads shall ensure that outsourcing arrangements do not diminish {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s ability to meet our contractual and compliance obligations.  Procedures shall be identified to ensure that the outsource provider employs the same standard of care in performing the services as would be employed by {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.  Department Heads shall not engage in outsourcing activities that have a high likelihood of damaging {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s image and reputation.
Per the Risk Assessment Policy, The Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Plan shall be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that controls are sufficient and effective at treating risks.  During the annual review, Department Heads shall review risks and controls related to outsourcing.  Material outsourcing arrangements have the potential to significantly impact {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s business operations, reputation, and profitability.  Department Heads shall use the following indicators to determine outsourcing materiality:
The level of importance of the service provided by the outsourcer
The potential impact on our organization should the outsourcer be unable to provide services
The potential impact of an outsourcer security breach
Outsourcer costs and related cost controls
Outsourcing risks that should be evaluated and analyzed by the Department Heads include:
Strategic Risk – the outsourcer may conduct business in a manner inconsistent with that of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}
Image Risk – unsatisfactory performance may impact {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s image and reputation
Operational Risk – the server provider many experience a failure in business operations and be unable to meet its contractual service levels or performance obligations
Compliance Risk – {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} may face compliance related risks related to privacy, security, and regulatory issues
Legal Risk – {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} may be faced with fines or penalties
Termination Risk – the loss of in-house Staff with specific skill sets might make it more difficult to terminate an agreement with an outsourcer
Outsourcing to any third party service provider can create risks that must be managed, regardless of the location of the provider.  Outsourcing to cross-border jurisdictions presents additional risks that must be managed:
Issues related to distance and/or different time zones
Risks related to the actions of foreign governments
Relying on a foreign legal system for enforcement
When analyzing an outsourcing arrangement, Department Heads should consider:
The ability of the service provider to comply with its obligations and meet the performance service levels required by the department
The compatibility of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Resources with those of the service provider
Excessive outsourcing arrangements with the service provider
Outsourcer staff is subjected to background checks equivalent to those performed on {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Staff
The outsourcing of any activity does not diminish our obligations and those of {{EXEC_MGMT}} who have the ultimate responsibility for the outsourced activity.  Outsourcing a business process or function shall not interfere with the ability of a department to effectively oversee and manage its activities.
{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} is responsible for the actions of the outsourcer and the confidentiality of information collected, transmitted, stored, or processed by the third party service provider.  Department Heads shall consider compliance, contractual, and legal requirements when qualifying, evaluating, and selecting an outsourcer.  Department Heads shall comply with {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Third Party Service Providers Policy.
Department Heads shall:
Communicate material outsourcing risks to {{EXEC_MGMT}} in a timely manner
Ensure procedures are in place to continuously monitor service provider performance to ensure services meet pre-established requirements
Ensure that outsourcing contingency plans are in place and tested at least annually
Ensure an independent review and audit of the outsourcer to ensure that risks remain within acceptable levels.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all Department Heads.
