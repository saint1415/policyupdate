## I. Overview

{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} is committed to protecting its employees, customers, partners and its operations.  This policy enables {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} to effectively deliver equipment and services that support company business processes.

## II. Purpose

This policy protects {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s assets and helps ensure our ability to continue business operations.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff that have access to Information Resources.

## IV. Policy

The IT Department shall only approve requests for variations on a domain name (whether for a physical server or a virtual server) to major departments or entities.  When a request for a domain name which doesn't include a leading "www" is approved, a second domain, which includes the leading "www," will also be generated.
The preferred format for domain names shall be: entity.ABCCompany.com/department/ or server.ABCCompany.com/department/.
Names will adequately, appropriately, and uniquely describe the unit/content, while keeping the address as short as possible.
Domain names shall be all lower case and shall not include spaces or any special characters (e.g. $, @, &).
When necessary, domain names shall use a hyphen to separate words.
The appropriate Department Head shall approve the request and forward to a System Administrator.  The System Administrator shall review the request for appropriateness and implement the request if it complies with this policy.  System Administrators shall watch for inappropriate words within the address, especially when combining words.  Requests that do not meet the requirements stated in this policy shall be forward to the IT Director for resolution.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff member found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all Staff responsible for installing, maintaining, and securing the network infrastructure.
