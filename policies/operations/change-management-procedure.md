## I. Overview

Managing changes is a critical part of providing a robust and valuable Information Resources infrastructure.  This procedure specifies the steps and actions performed to meet the requirements of ABC Company’s Change Management Policy.

## II. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to formally document the series of steps taken to meet the requirements specified in ABC Company's Change Management Policy.

## III. Scope

This procedure applies to all ABC Company Staff who perform and are responsible for managing changes to Information Resources.

## IV. Procedure

All changes affecting computing related environmental facilities (e.g., air-conditioning, water, heat, plumbing, electricity, alarms) are reported to or coordinated with the appropriate department head.
Written change requests are submitted for all changes, both scheduled and unscheduled.  All scheduled change requests are submitted in advance so that the Change Management Committee has time to review the request, determine and review potential failures, and make the decision to allow or delay the request.
The Change Management Committee meets on a regular basis to review change requests and  ensure that change reviews and communications are satisfactorily performed.  Each scheduled change request receives formal Change Management Committee approval before proceeding with the change.  The appointed leader of the Change Management Committee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to, inadequate planning, inadequate backout plans, security implications, the timing of the change will negatively impact a key business process such as year end accounting, or adequate resources cannot be readily available (e.g. weekends, holidays, or during special events).
Resource Owners are notified of each scheduled or unscheduled change.  A change review is completed for each change, whether scheduled or unscheduled, and whether successful or unsuccessful.  A Change Management Log Form is maintained for all changes. This log contains:
Date of submission and date of change
Owner and custodian contact information
Nature of the change
Indication of success or failure
Change management procedures ensure that:
Production data is not unnecessarily replicated or used in non-production environments
Device configuration is backed up prior to implementing the change
Restore procedures exist in the event the change is unsuccessful or does not accomplish the desired objective

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff member found to have violated this procedure may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This procedure is to be distributed to all ABC Company Department Heads and those responsible for information system security.
