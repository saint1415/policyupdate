## I. Overview

{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} is committed to protecting its Information Resources, Staff, customers, partners and its operations from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.  {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} assets are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations.

## II. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s ability to communicate and deliver messages consistently, in both emergency and nonemergency situations, in a manner that is both appropriate and effective and that best serves the organization’s strategic missions, goals, reputation and image.

## III. Scope

This policy covers all mass communications to all staff and business contacts via hard copy and across all media, required to operate the {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.

## IV. Policy

{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} uses five types of mass communication messages:
Crisis and/or emergency, including unscheduled ABC company closings
Changes to policies and/or changes or interruptions to standard operating procedures
Official communications
Official solicitations
General information
Mass communications are those print or electronic messages which are directed to audiences that exceed a Vice President’s area of responsibility and are sent without self-subscription or opt-out capabilities.  In most cases, electronic communication is preferable to paper communications.
All internal mass communications shall be limited to official business or official activities of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.  Employee e-mail addresses will be used as the primary channel of communication for all mass communication messages.  In those areas where employees do not have access to electronic means of communication, it is the responsibility of the Department Head to identify a system for communicating messages to these employees.  Examples of internal mass communication messages include:
Unscheduled {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} closings due to environmental (e.g. weather) or terrorist activities
Change in personnel related issues (e.g. holidays, health care benefits, working hours)
Security reminders
Emergency announcements shall temporarily be placed on the Staff portion of the {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} intranet.  In addition, automated messages can be sent to Staff voice mail.
External mass communications shall be limited to official business or official activities of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.  Examples of external mass communications include:
Press releases
Marketing product and service announcements
Customer communications
The {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} President or appropriate designate shall review and approve all mass communication messages before they are distributed internally, externally, or both.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff.
