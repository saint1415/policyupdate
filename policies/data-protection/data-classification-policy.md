## I. Overview

Data Classification provides a framework for managing data assets based on value and associated risks and for applying the appropriate levels of protection as required by state and federal law as well as proprietary, ethical, operational, and privacy considerations. All ABC Company data, whether electronic or printed, should be classified. The data owner, who is responsible for Data Classification, should consult with legal counsel on the classification of data as Public, Sensitive, or Confidential. Consistent use of data classification reinforces with users the expected level of protection of ABC Company data assets in accordance with ABC Company security policies.

## II. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to provide a foundation for the development and implementation of necessary security controls to protect information according to its value and/or risk. Security standards, which define these security controls and requirements, may include: document marking/labeling, release procedures, privacy, transmission requirements, printing protection, computer display protections, storage requirements, destruction methods, physical security requirements, access controls, backup requirements, transport procedures, encryption requirements, and incident reporting procedures.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all Staff that use ABC Company Information Resources.
