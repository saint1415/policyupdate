## I. Overview

Since all Information Systems rely on operating systems and networks to function, those areas are often targeted for attack and are the main sources of many security vulnerabilities.

## II. Purpose

Cybersecurity is the use of various technologies and processes to protect networks, computers, programs, and data.  Cybersecurity ensures that {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Systems are protected by security measures that prevent attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff responsible for the security of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Resources.

## IV. Policy

Cybersecurity helps to maintain an environment that encourages efficiency, innovation, and economic prosperity while promoting safety, security, business confidentiality, and privacy.
The {{CSO_TITLE}} (CSO) shall establish a risk-based framework core consisting of cybersecurity activities, outcomes, and references that provide guidance for developing individual organizational profiles.  The CSO shall:
Prioritize and scope.  Identify organization objectives and priorities and determine the scope of systems and assets that support the selected business line or process.
Orient.  Identify Information Systems and assets, regulatory requirements, and overall risk approach, identify threats to, and vulnerabilities of, those systems and assets.
Current Profile.  Identify categories, subcategories, and outcomes achieved.
Risk assessment.  Identify the likelihood of a cybersecurity event and the impact on the organization.  Consider emerging risks.
Target Profile.  Create a Target Profile focusing on categories, subcategories, and desired cybersecurity outcomes.
Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps.  Compare the Current Profile and the Target Profile to determine gaps and create a prioritized action plan to address those gaps.
Implement Action Plan.  Determine actions to take and monitor against the Target Profile.
The CSO shall consider how the cybersecurity program might incorporate privacy principles such as:
Individual consent to the use of personal information
Collecting the minimum amount of personal information
Controls over the use and disclosure of personal information
Use and retention of personal information related to a cybersecurity incident
Transparency for certain cybersecurity activities
Accountability and auditing

### A. Functions

The CSO shall identify five concurrent and continuous functions:
Identify.  To better align security with the organization, the CSO shall understand the business, resources, and cybersecurity risks.  Major categories (e.g. Asset Management, Governance, and Risk Management) shall be identified to assist in this effort.
Protect.  The CSO shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are implemented.  Major categories (e.g. Access Control, Security Awareness and Training, Data Security, and Maintenance) shall be identified to protect {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Systems.
Detect.  The CSO shall identify cybersecurity events.  Major categories shall include Anomalies and Events, Security Continuous Monitoring, and Detection Processes.
Respond.  The CSO shall identify actions regarding a detected event.  Major categories include Response Planning, Communications, Analysis, Mitigation, and Improvements.
Recover.  The CSO shall ensure {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Systems maintain resilience and restore capabilities.  Major categories include Recovery Planning, Improvements, and Communications.  See the Resilience Policy for more information.

### B. Implementation Tiers

The CSO shall identify how {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk.  The CSO shall identify implementation tiers that vary from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4).  The CSO shall identify {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s current implementation tier according to the following criteria:
Tier 1: Partial implementation.  Examples of partial implementation include risk management is not formalized, ad-hoc approach to security, limited awareness of cybersecurity risk, and no collaboration with other entities regarding cybersecurity events.
Tier 2: Risk Informed.  Examples of risk informed include management approves risk management, no wide management of cybersecurity risk, and no capabilities to share info externally.
Tier 3: Repeatable.  Examples of a repeatable implementation include risk management policies, organization-wide management of cybersecurity risk, and {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} receives information from partners that enables risk-based decisions.
Tier 4: Adaptive.  Examples of an adaptive implementation include the ability to adapt security based on lessons learned, predictive indicators, risk management is part of the organization’s culture, information is shared by and with other entities before an event occurs, and continuous awareness of activities on systems/networks.

### C. Profiles

A Profile is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.  A Profile enables {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} to establish a roadmap for reducing cybersecurity risk that is aligned with organizational goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements, industry best practices, and reflects risk management priorities.
Profiles help {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} align its cybersecurity activities with its business requirements, risk tolerances, and resources.  Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a “Current” Profile with a “Target” Profile.
The CSO shall compare the Current Profile with a proposed Target Profile to identify gaps to be addressed to meet cybersecurity risk management objectives.

### D. Cybersecurity Framework

The CSO shall develop a comprehensive framework that includes Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover), appropriate categories, subcategories, and applicable informative references.  See the Cybersecurity Framework Policy for more information.  The following table helps illustrate the relationship of Functions, Categories, Subcategories, and references.  Additional examples are available in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

### E. Policies

The CSO and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) shall ensure that {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s risks are properly managed and mitigated to the extent possible.  The CSO and CRO shall oversee the implementation and maintenance of formal policies that govern Information Resources.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Department Heads and those responsible for information and physical security.
