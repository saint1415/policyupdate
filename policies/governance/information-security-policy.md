Staff shall ensure Sensitive Information remains secure by clearing their desks when they will be away from their office, positioning monitors to prohibit unauthorized viewing, etc.  See the Clear Desk Policy for more information.
The CSO shall ensure that information is protected during its entire lifecycle.  Information shall only be retained for the duration of its useful life.  The disposal of hardware, software, and information requires special consideration.  Refer to the Data Retention Policy, Disposal Policy, Encryption Policy, and Removable Media Policy for more information.  {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s IT Department shall be responsible for developing, maintaining, and managing a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  Please refer to the Software Development Policy for more information.
Prior to granting individuals physical or logical access to Information Resources, agreements with Staff, third-party users, and customers shall be in place and include responsibility for information security.  Refer to the Third Party Service Providers Policy for more information.
For additional controls and safeguards please refer to the Security Policy.
