## I. Overview

Many Staff have personal hardware devices, software applications, utilities, tools, software development kits, and related products that do not meet {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s security requirements.

## II. Purpose

The purpose of this Policy is to establish the rules for the use of Staff owned devices and technologies that utilize and access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff that utilize Staff owned devices and technologies that utilize and access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.

## IV. Policy

While {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} has a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT) culture, risks related to these devices must be managed.
On an annual basis the IT Department shall survey {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff about devices, operating systems, applications, browsers, tools, utilities, scripts, software development kits, cloud services, and related technologies used.  The IT Department shall perform a BYODT analysis to determine:
If the devices and/or technologies used pose a risk to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s Information Systems.
Changes or configurations necessary to minimize risks to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s Information Resources.
Mandatory security components (e.g. firewall, anti-malware protection, passwords, browser security settings, patch management, encryption, physical controls) needed as a condition for allowing BYODT devices and technologies to access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.
Prohibited devices and technologies.
Devices and technologies allowed to access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Resources.
Level of access (e.g. restricted, full, guest, admin) granted to the devices and technologies.
Staff permitted and not permitted to use BYODT devices and technologies.
The IT Department shall implement controls that mitigate risks:
The IT Department shall ensure Staff access to sensitive data from BYODT devices and technologies have strict password and encryption controls in place.  See the Encryption Policy for more information.
Anti-malware software shall be used and updated on a regular basis.  See the Anti-Malware Policy for more information.
In some instances, the IT Department may identify applications that, due to their sensitive nature, may not be accessed by Staff BYODT devices and technologies.
Limit Staff activities performed on BYODT devices and technologies (e.g. no access to personal e-mail or social media).
The IT Department may restrict access to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources based upon Staff position responsibilities, geographical location, and lack of management approval.
The IT Department will keep the {{CSO_TITLE}} (CSO) informed of BYODT threats so that the security awareness and training program can be updated.
In the event a device is lost or stolen, the IT Department shall quickly block access to Information Resources from the device.  In addition, the IT Department shall:
Remotely wipe {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} data and applications, and/or
Remotely wipe the entire BYOD device if deemed necessary to ensure the security of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.  Wiping the entire BYOD device may have Staff implications including the inability to make calls, loss of contacts, need to have the device restored, etc.
{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} shall not be held liable for the loss of use or restoring of device, operating system, software applications, tools, scripts, data, etc.  Staff should take the proper precautions (e.g. physical controls over devices, backing up of contacts and files, etc.) to minimize any disruptions.
BYODT devices and technologies shall employ controls that meet the following requirements:
Password required at start up (power on).
Inactivity timeout (per the Access Control Policy).
Password change frequency (per the Password Policy).
Safeguards ensure only approved users of BYODT devices and technologies can access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.
Staff shall not:
“Root” or “jailbreak” a BYODT device and technology to free it from pre-defined limitations.  This process modifies the system files and can result in an unstable and insecure device.
Modify BOYDT device and technology hardware and/or software beyond installation of updates provided by the device maker or service provider.
Disable BYODT device and technology protection systems including passwords, encryption, firewalls, and anti-malware without the approval of the IT Department.
The IT Department shall prepare a list of authorized BYODT devices and technologies that are allowed to utilize and access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s Information Resources.  In addition, the IT Department shall specify specific configurations and circumstances under which BYODT devices and technologies may connect to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s Information Resources.
Per the Mobile Device Policy, only IT Department approved portable computing devices may be used to access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} networks and Information Resources.  Per the Smartphone Policy, only IT Department approved Smartphones may be used to access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} networks and Information Resources.  Per the Approved Application Policy, only approved software applications are allowed to access {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} networks and Information Resources.
Staff shall be responsible for adhering to the requirements of this Policy.  Staff shall notify the IT Department when:
A new BYODT device or technology is acquired and needs access to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.
A BYODT device or technology is taken out of service and is no longer used.
The Staff member’s role changes requiring a change in access (e.g. Staff member changes positions, Staff member on a leave of absence).
When choosing an appropriate plan, Staff should consider the additional voice minutes and data traffic that may be incurred.  Except as otherwise consistent with this Policy, {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} does not assume any financial responsibility for BYODT devices or technologies.  {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} shall not reimburse Staff for the following expenses:
BYODT device or technology initial cost, maintenance, or replacement
Recurring costs related to voice and data usage, roaming, etc.
Connectivity charges including Wi-Fi hotspots usage
Insurance
Expenses related to restoring BYODT devices or technologies if lost, corrupted (e.g. Malware, incompatible applications, changes to operating system), or damaged.
{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} shall reimburse Staff for the following expenses related to BYODT devices or technologies:
Approved app software for use with corporate systems (e.g. e-mail apps).
Approved anti-malware software.
Approved encryption software for use with corporate systems (e.g. VPN software).
The {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} IT Department shall perform periodic risk assessments to identify, manage, and reduce BYODT device and technology related risks and access to Information Resources.  Refer to the Risk Assessment Policy for more information.
The IT Department shall implement procedures and measures to strictly limit access to sensitive data from BYODT devices and technologies which are generally higher-risk than non-portable devices (e.g., desktop computers).

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff.
