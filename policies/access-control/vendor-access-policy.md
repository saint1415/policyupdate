## I. Overview

Vendors play an important role in the support of hardware and software management, and operations for customers. Vendors can remotely view, copy and modify data and audit logs, they correct software and operating systems problems, they can monitor and fine tune system performance, they can monitor hardware performance and errors, they can modify environmental systems, and reset alarm thresholds. Setting limits and controls on what can be seen, copied, modified, and controlled by vendors will eliminate or reduce the risk of loss of revenue, liability, loss of trust, and embarrassment to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}.

## II. Purpose

This policy establishes the rules for vendor access to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Resources and support services, vendor responsibilities, and protection of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all Staff that use {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Information Resources.

## IV. Policy

Vendors must comply with all applicable {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} policies, procedures, and agreements including, but not limited to:
Safety policies
Privacy policies
Security policies
Auditing policies
Software licensing policies
Acceptable use policies
The IT Department shall implement and maintain a consolidated list of vendors with access to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Information Resources.  Such list, as well as vendor agreements and contracts, must specify:
The {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} resources the vendor to which the vendor has access.
How {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information is to be protected by the vendor.
Acceptable methods for the return, destruction, or disposal of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information in the vendor’s possession at the end of the contract.
The vendor must only use {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information and Information Resources for the purpose of the business agreement.
Any other {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information acquired by the vendor in the course of the contract cannot be used for the vendor’s own purposes or divulged to others.
{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} will provide a point of contact for the Vendor.  The point of contact will work with the Vendor to make certain the Vendor is in compliance with {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} policies.
Each vendor must provide {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} with a list of all Staff working on the contract.  The list must be updated and provided to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} within 24 hours of staff changes.
Each on-site vendor employee must acquire an {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} identification badge that will be displayed at all times while on {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} premises.  The badge must be returned to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} when the employee leaves the contract or at the end of the contract.
Each vendor employee with access to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} sensitive information must be cleared to handle that information.
Vendor personnel must report all security incidents directly to the appropriate {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} personnel.  If vendor management is involved in {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} security incident management the responsibilities and details must be specified in the contract.
Vendor must follow all applicable {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} change control processes and procedures.
Regular work hours and duties will be defined in the contract. Work outside of defined parameters must be approved in writing by appropriate {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} management.
All vendor maintenance equipment on the {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} network that connects to the outside world via the network, telephone line, or leased line, and all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} IT vendor accounts will remain disabled except when in use for authorized maintenance.
Vendor access must be uniquely identifiable and password management must comply with the {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Password Policy.  Vendor’s major work activities must be entered into the Third Party Service Provider Log Form and available to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} management upon request.  Log entries must include, but are not limited to, such events as personnel changes, password changes, project milestones, deliverables, and arrival and departure times.
Upon departure of a vendor employee from the contract for any reason, the vendor will ensure that all sensitive information is collected and returned to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} or destroyed within 24 hours.
Upon termination of contract or at the request of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}, the vendor will return or destroy all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} information and provide written certification of that return or destruction within 24 hours.
Upon termination of contract or at the request of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}, the vendor must surrender all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} identification badges, access cards, equipment and supplies immediately.  Equipment and/or supplies to be retained by the vendor must be documented by authorized {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} management.
Vendors are required to comply with all State and {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} auditing requirements, including the auditing of the vendor’s work.
All software used by the vendor in providing service to {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} must be properly inventoried and licensed.
Third-party agreements that directly, or indirectly, impact Information Resources are required to -include explicit coverage of all relevant security requirements.  This includes agreements involving processing, accessing, communicating, hosting or managing the organization's information assets, or adding or terminating services or products to existing information.  Asset agreements provisions shall include security (e.g., encryption, access controls, and leakage prevention) and integrity controls for data exchanged to prevent improper disclosure, alteration or destruction.

## V. Enforcement

Any Staff found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## VI. Distribution

This policy is to be distributed to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Staff.
