## I. Overview

Vendors play an important role in the support of hardware and software management, and operations for customers. Vendors can remotely view, copy and modify data and audit logs, they correct software and operating systems problems, they can monitor and fine tune system performance, they can monitor hardware performance and errors, they can modify environmental systems, and reset alarm thresholds. Setting limits and controls on what can be seen, copied, modified, and controlled by vendors will eliminate or reduce the risk of loss of revenue, liability, loss of trust, and embarrassment to ABC Company.
