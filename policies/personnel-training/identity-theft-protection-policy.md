## I. Overview

Policies and procedures help ABC Company meet compliance requirements by addressing identify theft issues in a uniform and consistent manner.  For example, they dictate the steps to be followed when we receive a notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency.

## II. Purpose

The purpose of the Identity Theft Protection Policy is to establish the rules for the creation, monitoring, control, and maintenance of covered accounts.

## III. Scope

This policy applies to all ABC Company Staff that have access to ABC Company’s customer information.

## IV. Policy

### A. Program Coordinator

ABC Company has appointed a Program Coordinator of our Identity Theft Red Flags Program.  The Program Coordinator shall prepare an identity theft Risk Assessment Report to determine whether ABC Company offers or maintains covered accounts as defined in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 (“FACTA”).  At a minimum, the Risk Assessment Report shall review the accounts and services offered, assess past incidents, document suspicious information, evaluate identity theft detection methods, and assess response procedures.
The Program Coordinator shall design, implement, and maintain policies and procedures implementing identity theft detection procedures, response procedures, and an Identify Theft Protection Program to address identity theft and satisfy the requirements of FACTA legislation.  The Identity Theft Protection Program shall include, but not be limited to, services offered, policies and procedures related to identity theft, relevant red flags, detection, prevention, and mitigation actions, as well as updates to the Identity Theft Protection Program.
Specific responsibilities that have been delegated to the Program Coordinator include:
Identifying and assessing the risks of identity theft and discovery of address discrepancies in each relevant area of the Company’s operation, and evaluating the effectiveness of current safeguards that have been implemented to control these risks and to respond to situations in an appropriate fashion.
Designing and implementing policies and procedures that are appropriate for the size and complexity of our Company and its operations considering the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of the customer information we collect, store, and share with others.
Regularly monitoring and testing the policies and procedures for compliance with all applicable law and to determine the effectiveness of our procedure in preventing identity theft.
Assisting with the selection of appropriate service providers that are capable of maintaining safeguards to protect against identity theft and reviewing service provider contracts to ensure that each maintains appropriate procedures for identifying and responding to situations involving identity theft.
Evaluating and adjusting this procedure in light of relevant circumstances, including changes to ABC Company’s operations, business relationships, technological developments and/or other matters that may impact the security or integrity of customer information and response to identity theft.
The Program Coordinator is the contact person for law enforcement agencies to communicate possible situations of identity theft.  Upon receiving a request for information from any law enforcement agency, the Program Coordinator will:
Provide the law enforcement agency with his/her name, title, and appropriate contact information, such as a mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number and facsimile number, and notify the law enforcement agency promptly of any modifications with respect to contact information.
If ABC Company has identified possible identity theft or becomes aware of an address discrepancy, the Program Coordinator will send a Report to the customer, as necessary, and to the appropriate law enforcement agency that contains:
The name of the individual, entity or organization
The account numbers or, in the case of transactions, the date and type of each transaction
The Social Security Number, taxpayer identification number, passport number, date of birth, address, or other personal identifying information provided by the individual or entity at the time of the transaction.
To assist in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations, the Program Coordinator will audit the Company’s Policies and Procedures at least bi-annually to determine if the current system is operating effectively to prevent/detect identity theft and to deal with notice of any address discrepancy. Any modification of the system that the Program Coordinator deems appropriate will be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.  As part of the audit program, Company personnel will be encouraged to advise the Program Coordinator of any newly identified risks to customers or to the safety of the Company regarding identity theft. To the extent of any newly identified risk that is discovered, the Program Coordinator is authorized to take appropriate action to address the risk, including assessment, independently or through third parties, of the severity of this risk, and make modifications of the audit system by written instruction to all necessary personnel or through obtaining outside products or services to alleviate the risk.
At least annually, the Program Coordinator will report to management:
The effectiveness of the Program
Explaining “significant events” involving identity theft and management’s response to any incident
Providing recommendations for substantive/material changes to the Policies and Procedures due to evolving risks and methods of identity theft.

### B. Employee Management and Training

All current employees and new hires, as well as independent contractors who provide services to or that perform services on behalf of ABC Company, will:
Be subject to satisfactory reference and consumer/criminal report investigations, where appropriate.
Only have access to customer information if they have a business reason for seeing it.
Participate in the Company’s privacy policies and information security standards and identity theft and notice of address discrepancy training program and attend education and training seminars on a regular basis, if not otherwise provided for by any independent contractor for its own employees.

Be responsible for protecting the confidentiality and security of the customer information our Company collects and for using the information in accordance with our Policies and Procedures.
Not be permitted to post passwords near their computers or share passwords with any other person.
Refer telephone calls or other requests for customer information to the Program Coordinator or appropriate manager when such requests are not received within the ordinary course of the Company’s business or are for information that the employee is not authorized to provide.
Disclose to service providers, marketers or any other parties only that customer information which is necessary to complete a transaction initiated by the customer and/or as permitted by law.  If an employee is unsure as to whether a specific disclosure is permitted, he or she will be instructed to check with the Program Coordinator or appropriate manager prior to releasing the information.
Be required to notify the Program Coordinator or appropriate manager immediately of any attempts by unauthorized persons to obtain access to customer information and/or if any password or customer information is subject to unauthorized access.

### C. Obtaining Customer Information and Verifying Customer identities

The following procedures will be implemented with respect to obtaining customer information and verifying customer identities:
Forms utilized by the Company request customer information, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, social security numbers, tax identification numbers, and driver’s license and insurance information, to enable the Company to verify the identification of its customers. In addition, customers must sign documentation, including sworn statements in some cases, wherein the customer represents and warrants that he/she is the person identified in the documentation.
Employees will request to see the customer’s driver’s license or other form of government-issued identification bearing a photograph to verify the customer’s identity and will make a copy of the same to retain in the customer’s file. If a customer requests financing in connection with a transaction, the customer will be required to provide employment information and references and must authorize the Company to obtain a credit report, all of which may be utilized to verify the identity of the customer and be used to check for any notice of an address discrepancy. Employees may also request copies of the customer’s utility bills, bank or credit card statements and paycheck stubs.
In the event that customer information provided is conflicting or cannot be verified upon further inquiry, employees shall request additional government-issued documentation evidencing the customer’s residence and bearing a photograph or other safeguard (i.e. a social security card, alien identification card, or passport) to enable employees to form a reasonable belief that they know a customer’s true identity.  When appropriate, employees shall write a summary of the means and results of any measures taken to identify a customer, including the resolution of any discrepancy in the identifying information obtained.  Employees will be instructed to notify the Program Coordinator if customer information still cannot be verified, or if the employees have obtained information regarding an address discrepancy that cannot be explained.
Paper and electronic records containing customer information and relevant to the Company’s identity verification process will be retained by the Company in accordance with federal and state record retention requirements.  Upon the expiration of the appropriate retention period, any such records will be disposed of in a secure manner in accordance with the Company’s information security standards.
