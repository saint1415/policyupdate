## I. Purpose of the Business Continuity Plan

Business continuity ensures that ABC Company (ABC Company) can continue to provide services during business disruptions.  The emphasis for business continuity is on critical business processes that need to be recovered in the event of a disaster.

## II. Overview of the Business Continuity Plan

Business continuity planning involves arranging for emergency operations of critical business functions and for resource recovery planning of these functions following a natural or man-made disruption.
This Business Continuity Plan is only one component of ABC Company’s business continuity planning process.  Plans are needed for all organizational units and include the logistics of establishing policy, providing guidance, ensuring staff are trained on appropriate procedures, and ensuring testing and maintenance of the plan.

## III. Business Continuity Policy

ABC Company’s Business Continuity Policy provides overall guidance and direction for business continuity planning and related activities.
Business continuity plans are no longer a luxury, but an essential element of ABC Company’s risk management program.  The decision to invest in business continuity is required by legislation, third parties (e.g., insurers), and the realistic view that management must minimize the impact of a disaster on business operations.
ABC Company’s Business Continuity Policy is in place to protect ABC Company and its ability to continue business operations in the event of a disaster or component failure information assets.  Business continuity requires management to identify risks and install the appropriate mitigating technologies.
An up-to-date Business Continuity Plan creates a competitive advantage out of its ability to respond to rapid changes in its environment.  ABC Company can then move from simple recovery to experiencing the benefits associated with the continuing of business operations that are in line with the corporate strategy of facilitating growth and profitability.

## IV. Business Impact Analysis

ABC Company’s Business Impact Analysis (BIA) helps identify the business processes and applications that are essential to the survival of the business.  The Business Impact Analysis identifies the amount of acceptable data loss (recovery point objective) as well as the speed at which systems must be restored (recovery time objective).
Business impacts are identified based on a worst-case scenario assuming that the infrastructure supporting each department has been destroyed and all records, equipment, etc. are not immediately accessible.
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies mission critical business functions and associated critical resources.  Determining critical business functions and the impact on the organization is the first step in business continuity.  The Business Impact Analysis:
Identifies important business processes
Determines processes critical to the business
Estimates the potential impact and recovery timeframes
Prioritizes critical processes

## V. Business Continuity Disaster Recovery Plan

The primary objective of business continuity is to help ensure the operation of Company’s business by providing the ability to successfully continue operations in the event of a disaster or emergency.
ABC Company’s management is responsible for protecting all assets of our organization.  These assets include employees, physical property, information, and records relating to the conduct of the business.

## VI. Business Continuity Business Resumption Plan

ABC Company has a large variety of processes whose continuous operations are critical to the organization’s continuing viability.  Business resumption planning involves arranging for emergency operations of these critical business functions and for resource recovery planning of these functions following a natural or man-made disruption.
This Business Continuity Business Resumption Plan is only one component of ABC Company’s business continuity planning process.  Business continuity operations plans are needed for all organizational units and include the logistics of getting personnel to work locations, temporary s, recovery facilities, and housing.  Employee safety orientation and insurance programs must also be included in business resumption planning.
ABC Company’s business resumption plan contains:
Backup resource arrangements
Procedures for notification, activation, mobilization, and emergency operations
Resources at all facilities (permanent and temporary)
ABC Company management will direct staff to implement emergency procedures.  In most disaster situations, data will be lost.  Departments must re-create lost data in addition to continuing existing business operations.
The Emergency Action Applications Team will coordinate with users and assist in identifying data that needs to be re-created.  The Emergency Action Applications Team will also monitor recovery progress to ensure systems are operating correctly.

## VII. Business Continuity Communications Plan

The Business Continuity Communications Plan provides procedures to coordinate communications within the organization, and between the organization, the media, and the public in the event of an emergency or controversial issue.  Emergencies may include fires, bomb threats, natural disasters, or major crimes.  Controversial issues may include police investigations, protests, or other situations that demand a public response.
The Business Continuity Communications Plan is not intended to change the way emergencies are initially reported.  All emergencies should be reported immediately to management.
The Business Continuity Communications Plan not only addresses media relations and communications issues, but also includes procedures for the rapid identification of potentially harmful situations and the methods for responding to these situations quickly and effectively.
It is the goal of the Business Continuity Communications Plan to establish guidelines for dealing with a variety of situations, and to ensure that management and its authorized representatives are familiar with those procedures and their roles in the event of a disruption.  The Business Continuity Communications Plan is designed to be used in conjunction with the normal decision making hierarchy of ABC Company and does not supplant that decision making process.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with operational crisis response plans managed through facilities, operations, and other units.
ABC Company has a large variety of processes whose continuous operations are critical to the organization’s continuing viability.  The team leader of the Communications Team is responsible for:
Factually assessing the situation and determining whether a communications response is warranted.

Orientation material is also needed for all employees in both the life safety and Plan areas.  Detailed emergency operations plans are needed:
Before a disaster for use during testing

While the IT Department is responsible for off-site storage of electronic data, all ABC Company departments should evaluate manual recovery documents such as paper based data, forms, and procedures that must be stored off-site.  ABC Company departments will make the appropriate arrangements to ensure manual recovery documents, special forms, checks, etc. are stored off-site.  These documents assist the individuals departments and minimize a business disruption::

Testing.  Testing and training procedures should be developed.
