## I. Purpose of the Business Continuity of Operations Department Plan

Business continuity ensures that critical processes will continue to perform service throughout an emergency or disruption.  The purpose of this Business Continuity of Operations Department Plan (Plan) is to address the restoration of this department’s business processes after a business disruption either internal, within the department, or external, outside of the department.
This Plan, along with the other Business Continuity documents, supports {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}’s Business Continuity Policy that provides overall guidance and direction for business continuity planning and related activities.

## II. Overview of the Business Continuity of Operations Department Plan

This department performs the following important services and processes:
