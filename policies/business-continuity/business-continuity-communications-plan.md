## I. Purpose Of The Business Continuity Communications Plan

The purpose of business continuity is to enable ABC Company (Company) to continue offering critical services in the event of a disruption.  The Business Continuity Communications Plan (Plan) allows ABC Company to communicate with employees, vendors, consultants, customers, service providers, and the media.

## II. Business Continuity Philosophy

Business continuity planning is a process designed to reduce ABC Company’s business risk arising from an unexpected disruption of the critical functions and operations (both manual and automated) necessary for the survival of the organization.  A critical element of business continuity is ABC Company’s ability to communicate effectively and clearly with our employees, vendors, consultants, customers, service providers, and the media.

## III. Plan Statement

This Plan provides procedures for the coordination of communications within the organization, and between the organization, the media, and the public in the event of an emergency or controversial issue.  Emergencies may include fires, bomb threats, natural disasters, or major crimes. Controversial issues may include police investigations, protests, or other situations that demand a public response.
This Plan is not intended to change the way emergencies are initially reported.  All emergencies should be reported immediately to management.
This Plan not only addresses media relations and communications issues, but also includes procedures for the rapid identification of potentially harmful situations and the methods for responding to these situations quickly and effectively.
It is the goal of this Plan to establish guidelines for dealing with a variety of situations, and to ensure that management and its authorized representatives are familiar with those procedures and their roles in the event of a disruption.  The Plan is designed to be used in conjunction with the normal decision making hierarchy of ABC Company and does not supplant that decision making process.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with operational crisis response plans managed through facilities, operations, and other units.

## IV. Objectives Of The Plan

ABC Company has a large variety of processes whose continuous operations are critical to the organization’s continuing viability.  The team leader of the Communications Team is responsible for:
Factually assessing the situation and determining whether a communications response is warranted.
Assembling the Communication Team that will make recommendations on appropriate responses.
Implement immediate action to identify staff that should be informed about the situation, communicate facts about the situation, minimize rumors, and help restore order and/or confidence
This Business Continuity Communications Plan is only one component of ABC Company’s business continuity planning processes.  Business resumption plans are needed for all organizational units and include the logistics of getting personnel to work locations, temporary s, recovery facilities, and housing.  Employee safety orientation and insurance programs must also be included in business resumption planning.

## V. General Procedures For Communications

### D. Key groups

Listed below are key groups and procedures to follow when communicating the events of the disruption.
Employees - communicating the continuity plan to staff is essential as employees need to understand what to do if an incident occurs.  Let all staff members know as soon as possible.  Make sure that people who are not at work that day are aware of the incident.  Tell staff about next steps and when the premises will be available.  Ask line managers to talk to their teams about the experience and how it will impact their roles.
Local police and authorities.  To work smoothly with these experts, you need to be aware of what your local authority and emergency services will do in an incident and discuss the communications plan with them once it has been developed.
Customers or clients - reassure customers and clients that ABC Company is prepared to address the incident and will let them know how they are affected.  Consider using the ABC Company web site to communicate information.  Transfer key phone numbers to an alternative phone, so people can still get through.  Ask staff to contact any clients they work with closely to explain the situation.
Media - Skillful handling of the media can prevent potentially negative comments.  Coordinate media management.
Suppliers - let suppliers know if deliveries need to be sent to a different location or postponed.
Financial services (banks) - Contact bank as quickly as possible with a report on the situation.  Be prepared to outline any losses and give an estimate for when ABC Company can resume normal business.  Organize loans or overdraft protection.

## VIII. Aftermath

### A. Communications

Following any disruption, appropriate action must take place to ensure that members of the ABC Company community, and others as necessary, receive needed information and assistance to help bring closure to the issue as well as relief from the effects of the event.  Attention also should be placed on identifying and implementing measures to improve the action plan used during the disruption.
If needed, a public forum should be scheduled and coordinated by Public Affairs to communicate details of the incident and events to all interested members of ABC Company.  The timeliness of this meeting is critical and every effort should be made to see that it occurs within one week from the close of the disruption.  Representatives from local Police, employees, and Human Resources should attend and be prepared to answer questions and share pertinent information.  Specific departments and/or individuals also may be requested to attend and participate depending upon the nature of the issue.
Immediately following a disruption, it is imperative that ABC Company be sensitive to the needs of faculty, staff and employees who may have been personally affected by the disaster.  There may be a need to assist a victim, or victims with obtaining information and/or a referral to available resources.
It is not unreasonable to expect that rumors might follow a disruption, further creating an atmosphere of anxiety.  One means of combating rumors would be to take full advantage of electronic mail, web site notices, rumor-control hotlines, and report facts as appropriate.
Depending upon the nature of the disruption, services and assistance may have been provided by agencies, companies, and/or individuals from outside ABC Company.  Management should ensure that applicable follow-up information, as well as thank-you letters, are forwarded to appropriate persons.
The Communications Team shall meet within 10 days following a disruption and review all actions taken as a result of the issue to determine effectiveness and efficiency of operations and make any needed changes to this Plan.

### B. Clean up

Facilities is responsible for overseeing and implementing services necessary to clean and repair areas and facilities damaged as a result of a crisis.  Facilities and IT should jointly ensure clean up after a business disruption.

### C. Facility evacuation/operational shutdowns

It may become necessary to evacuate buildings and/or areas surrounding facilities to protect and ensure the safety of staff.  If such a situation occurs, decisions regarding work space accommodations, leave requirements for staff, work schedules, and possible housing accommodations for employees needs to be addressed.
Issues surrounding leave for staff employees should be directed to Human Resources.  Note: normally time away from work is accounted for through current leave policies.

### D. Updates

This plan will be updated regularly.  The Communications Team should be assembled periodically to discuss the plan and any updates.  The Chief Operating Officer will serve as Team Leader and convene these meetings.  Results of the meetings and revisions of the plan are to be documented.  Copies of this plan should be addressed to all employees listed in this Plan and any other personnel who might play a role in the event of a disruption.
