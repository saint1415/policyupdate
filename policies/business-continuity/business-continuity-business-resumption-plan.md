## I. Purpose of the Business Resumption Plan

The purpose of the Business Continuity Business Resumption Plan (Plan) is to address the restoration of business processes after an emergency.  This Plan, along with the Business Continuity Communications Plan, supports the Business Continuity Disaster Recovery Plan to ensure the continuity of critical processes throughout an emergency or disruption.  ABC Company’s Business Continuity Policy provides overall guidance and direction for business continuity planning and related activities.

## II. Overview of the Business Resumption Plan

ABC Company has a large variety of processes whose continuous operations are critical to the organization’s continuing viability.  Business resumption planning involves arranging for emergency operations of these critical business functions and for resource recovery planning of these functions following a natural or man-made disruption.
This Business Continuity Business Resumption Plan is only one component of ABC Company’s business continuity planning process.  Business resumption plans are needed for all organizational units and include the logistics of getting personnel to work locations, temporary s, recovery facilities, and housing.  Employee safety orientation and insurance programs must also be included in business resumption planning.
ABC Company’s business resumption plan contains:
Backup resource arrangements
Procedures for notification, activation, mobilization, and emergency operations
Resources at all facilities (permanent and temporary)

## III. Preparing For A Disaster

### A. Information Needed Before a Disaster

A formal Plan is needed for orientation of employees that will be involved in activating the plan and performing emergency operations. Orientation material is also needed for all employees in both the life safety and Plan areas.  Detailed emergency operations plans are needed:
Before a disaster for use during testing
After a disaster for use during emergency operations
ABC Company’s departments shall prepare the following:
Off-site contingency site.  ABC Company’s Emergency Action Facilities Team shall arrange an off-site contingency site with work areas, conference rooms, and s.  The off-site contingency site can be utilized by ABC Company employees until existing facilities are restored to normal operations or new facilities are available for occupancy.
Activation.  Departments should create documented activation and mobilization procedures.
Recovery documents.  While the IT Department is responsible for off-site storage of electronic data, all ABC Company departments should evaluate manual recovery documents such as paper based data, forms, and procedures that must be stored off-site.  ABC Company departments will make the appropriate arrangements to ensure manual recovery documents, special forms, checks, etc. are stored off-site.  These documents assist the individuals departments and minimize a business disruption.
Contact lists.  Departments should maintain emergency contact notification lists of all staff in their respective areas.
Supporting information.  In addition to the above, each department should maintain information, as appropriate, to assist in recovery operations.  Backup resources such as locations and functions should be identified.
Testing  Testing and training procedures should be developed.

### B. Information Needed During a Disaster

Employee emergency reference cards.  Wallet size cards can be distributed to all employees. They contain both life-safety and information such as assembly locations, emergency operations policy, and numbers to call for information.
Notification/Activation reference cards.  Fold over pocket size cards contain a management call-tree, key assembly and backup resource addresses and telephone numbers, and emergency team contact information.
Team emergency operations procedures.  Detailed team operations procedures are normally needed only when multiple locations performing the same business function exist.  Such locations require detailed procedures since they are normally not staffed with the senior personnel needed to adapt policy level directives to the specifics of a particular emergency. This type of procedure is lengthy and difficult to prepare since it must anticipate various types and levels of disasters.
Team emergency reference cards.  Fold over pocket size cards contain the team member call-tree, an activity checklist, and backup resource information. Typical teams include: policy, emergency operations center, facility management, site recovery, backup data center operations, logistics, off-site storage coordination, floor wardens, assembly site coordinators, public/employee communications, telecommunications, etc.
Resource tabulations.  These tabulations contain such information as: lists of all resources by location including replacement information and backup resource locations; where all personnel are to report during emergency operations; and where to forward data and materials from off-site storage.

## IV. Disaster

### A. Disaster notification

In the event of an emergency or disaster, the following notifying procedures must be followed:
The Emergency Coordinator should initiate the notification process as soon as possible.  If no operations personnel are on duty, management has been provided with the proper procedures and must notify the Emergency Coordinator who will then initiate the notification process.
The Emergency Coordinator is at the top of the Emergency Notification List.  If the Emergency Coordinator cannot be reached, the Alternate Emergency Coordinator must be contacted.
The first member of the Readiness Team notified is responsible to notify other members of the Readiness Team and to initiate action.  The initial action will be to assemble the Readiness Team at the    or the .
The Emergency Coordinator will make an assessment of the situation directly at the scene if possible, or if not, indirectly based on reported information from the notification sources.
Based on the Readiness Team's assessment of the situation, the Emergency Coordinator will determine the severity of the problem and decide on the appropriate action.
The appropriate correction or recovery plans will be implemented according to the severity of the emergency or disaster.

### B. Administrative team

The Administrative Team will determine the procedures for all administrative assistance regarding hotel arrangements, flight schedules, etc.
Administrative Coordinating Procedures
Work with Company management to determine extent and duration of resources needed.
Identify locations and individuals involved.
Gather and provide the necessary resources.

### C. User department responsibilities

ABC Company management will direct staff to implement emergency procedures.  In most disaster situations, data will be lost.  Departments must re-create lost data in addition to continuing existing business operations.
The Emergency Action Applications Team will coordinate with users and assist in identifying data that needs to be re-created.  The Emergency Action Applications Team will also monitor recovery progress to ensure systems are operating correctly.
After the department personnel have been deployed, the department managers should track the location of their employees and continue to update the information throughout each day of the recovery operation.
User departments will create a log of daily events and tasks performed.  This log will aid in recovery efforts as well as assist in a post disaster review of events.
Department managers should prepare written status reports on a frequent basis and, as requested by company management, to keep them apprised of the current status
As progress continues during the recovery operation, departments should be prepared to move back to the affected facility and resume normal business operations.

## V. Procedures for Returning to Normal Operations

The following procedures are for returning to normal operations after emergency (recovery) operations.

### A. Emergency action team procedures

The Emergency Coordinator must notify company management when business operations can be transferred to the original facilities or to new facilities.  As business operations are transferred back to normal operations, the recovery procedure will very quickly be phased down.  The Emergency Action Operations Team must leave the Contingency Site with all property and materials belonging to the organization, and use due care and caution to protect all Company information.
The Emergency Coordinator and Readiness Team must maintain a full state of readiness during, and particularly after, returning to normal operations.  The Emergency Action Operations Team will be directed to return materials back to their proper offsite storage, including current materials and media.
The Emergency Action Operations Team must inform all users that the emergency or disaster is over and that operations are now or soon to be returned to normal.  The  will be deactivated.
The final activity of the recovery process will be the meeting and debriefing of the Readiness Team, all Coordinators, and Emergency Action Team Leaders concerning the activities of the recovery.  The Emergency Coordinator is responsible to make sure that events, problems and solutions, etc., are documented.  Once documentation is complete, the Emergency Action Teams and Readiness Team can be deactivated.  During the next review of the Plan, the Emergency Coordinator will be responsible to ensure that any lessons learned are incorporated into the Plan.

### B. User department procedures

Upon notification from the Emergency Action Operations Team that the disaster is over, user departments will:
Ensure that all materials have been collected from the disaster recovery work areas.  This includes both traditional paper documents as well as electronically stored information.
Resume operations at the repaired facility or new facility as appropriate.  User departments shall follow their operations procedures to ensure a smooth transition in this process.

## VI. After a Disaster

Following the disaster, each department will document the events that transpired including any recommended changes to their procedures.  The disaster results will then be reviewed by ABC Company management.
